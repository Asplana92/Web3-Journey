- Docker containers (memory/CPU)
- Nginx SSL endpoints

‚úÖ Planned deliverables:
- Docker Compose configuration for Prometheus & Grafana  
- Dashboards + alerts for uptime and request latency  
- Public screenshot for report Stage 2 completion

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Notes & Next Steps

- Prepare dashboard JSON export for GitHub repo.  
- Share Stage 2 completion post on Discord + Twitter once monitoring stack is verified.
